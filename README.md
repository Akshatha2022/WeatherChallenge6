User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Work Done:

After a HTML doc is created I started to work on JAVASCRIPT and to start I created an event listener for the search button was created in order to initiate a function that captures what the user entered, and then use that input in order to manipulate/utilize the weather API





Mock-Up
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

A screenshot displays a weather dashboard that includes a search function and a five-day forecast.
